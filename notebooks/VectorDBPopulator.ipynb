The earliest computers were programmed in first-generation\\nprogramming languages (1GLs), machine language (simple instructions that could be directly\\nexecuted by the processor). This code was very difficult to debug and was not portable between\\n[10]\\ndifferent computer systems. In order to improve the ease of programming, assembly\\nlanguages (or second-generation programming languages—2GLs) were invented, diverging\\nfrom the machine language to make programs easier to understand for humans, although they\\ndid not increase portability.[11]\\nInitially, hardware resources were scarce and expensive, while human resources were cheaper.\\nTherefore, cumbersome languages that were time-consuming to use, but were closer to the\\n[12]\\nhardware for higher efficiency were favored. The introduction of high-level programming\\nlanguages (third-generation programming languages—3GLs)—revolutionized programming.\\nThese languages abstracted away the details of the hardware, instead being designed to express\\nalgorithms that could be understood more easily by humans. For example, arithmetic\\nexpressions could now be written in symbolic notation and later translated into machine code\\n[11]\\nthat the hardware could execute. In 1957, Fortran (FORmula TRANslation) was invented.\\nOften considered the first compiled high-level programming language,[11][13] Fortran has\\n[14]\\nremained in use into the twenty-first century.\\n1960s and 1970s\\nAround 1960, the first mainframes—general purpose computers—were developed, although\\nthey could only be operated by professionals and the cost was extreme. The data and\\ninstructions were input by punch cards, meaning that no input could be added while the\\nprogram was running. The languages developed at this time therefore are designed for minimal\\n[16]\\ninteraction. After the invention of the microprocessor, computers in the 1970s became\\ndramatically cheaper.[17] New computers also allowed more user interaction, which was\\n[18]\\nsupported by newer programming languages.\\n[19]\\nLisp, implemented in 1958, was the first functional programming language. Unlike Fortran,\\nit supported recursion and conditional expressions,[20] and it also introduced dynamic memory\\n[21]\\nmanagement on a heap and automatic garbage collection.

Some notable features\\nare described below.\\nType system\\nA data type is a set of allowable values and operations that can be performed on these values.\\n[60]\\nEach programming language's type system defines which data types exist, the type of an\\nexpression, and how type equivalence and type compatibility function in the language.[61]\\nAccording to type theory, a language is fully typed if the specification of every operation defines\\n[62]\\ntypes of data to which the operation is applicable. In contrast, an untyped language, such as\\nmost assembly languages, allows any operation to be performed on any data, generally\\n[62]\\nsequences of bits of various lengths. In practice, while few languages are fully typed, most\\noffer a degree of typing.[62]\\nBecause different types (such as integers and floats) represent values differently, unexpected\\nresults will occur if one type is used when another is expected. Type checking will flag this error,\\n[63]\\nusually at compile time (runtime type checking is more costly). With strong typing, type\\nerrors can always be detected unless variables are explicitly cast to a different type. Weak typing\\noccurs when languages allow implicit casting—for example, to enable operations between\\nvariables of different types without the programmer making an explicit type conversion. The\\n[64]\\nmore cases in which this type coercion is allowed, the fewer type errors can be detected.\\nCommonly supported types\\nEarly programming languages often supported only built-in, numeric types such as the integer\\n(signed and unsigned) and floating point (to support operations on real numbers that are not\\nintegers). Most programming languages support multiple sizes of floats (often called float and\\ndouble) and integers depending on the size and precision required by the programmer. Storing\\nan integer in a type that is too small to represent it leads to integer overflow. The most common\\nway of representing negative numbers with signed types is twos complement, although ones\\ncomplement is also used.[65] Other common types include Boolean—which is either true or false\\n[66]\\n—and character—traditionally one byte, sufficient to represent all ASCII characters.\\nArrays are a data type whose elements, in many languages, must consist of a single type of fixed\\nlength. Other languages define arrays as references to data stored elsewhere and support\\n[67]\\nelements of varying types. Depending on the programming language, sequences of multiple\\ncharacters, called strings, may be supported as arrays of characters or their own primitive type.\\n[68] Strings may be of fixed or variable length, which enables greater flexibility at the cost of\\n[69]\\nincreased storage space and more complexity. Other data types that may be supported\\n[70] [71]\\ninclude lists, associative (unordered) arrays accessed via keys, records in which data is\\nmapped to names in an ordered structure,[72] and tuples—similar to records but without names\\n[73]\\nfor data fields.

Since the mid-1980s, most programming\\nlanguages also support abstract data types, in which the representation of the data and\\noperations are hidden from the user, who can only access an interface.[76] The benefits of data\\nabstraction can include increased reliability, reduced complexity, less potential for name\\ncollision, and allowing the underlying data structure to be changed without the client needing to\\n[77]\\nalter its code.\\nStatic and dynamic typing\\nIn static typing, all expressions have their types determined before a program executes, typically\\n[62]\\nat compile-time. Most widely used, statically typed programming languages require the\\ntypes of variables to be specified explicitly. In some languages, types are implicit; one form of\\nthis is when the compiler can infer types based on context. The downside of implicit typing is\\nthe potential for errors to go undetected.[78] Complete type inference has traditionally been\\n[79]\\nassociated with functional languages such as Haskell and ML.\\nWith dynamic typing, the type is not attached to the variable but only the value encoded in it. A\\nsingle variable can be reused for a value of a different type. Although this provides more\\nflexibility to the programmer, it is at the cost of lower reliability and less ability for the\\n[80]\\nprogramming language to check for errors. Some languages allow variables of a union type\\nto which any type of value can be assigned, in an exception to their usual static typing rules.[81]\\nConcurrency\\nIn computing, multiple instructions can be executed simultaneously. Many programming\\n[82]\\nlanguages support instruction-level and subprogram-level concurrency. By the twenty-first\\ncentury, additional processing power on computers was increasingly coming from the use of\\nadditional processors, which requires programmers to design software that makes use of\\n[83]\\nmultiple processors simultaneously to achieve improved performance. Interpreted\\nlanguages such as Python and Ruby do not support the concurrent use of multiple processors.\\n[84] Other programming languages do support managing data shared between different threads\\nby controlling the order of execution of key instructions via the use of semaphores, controlling\\n[85]\\naccess to shared data via monitor, or enabling message passing between threads.\\nException handling\\nMany programming languages include exception handlers, a section of code triggered by\\n[86]\\nruntime errors that can deal with them in two main ways:\\nTermination: shutting down and handing over control to the operating system. This option is\\nconsidered the simplest.\\nResumption: resuming the program near where the exception occurred. This can trigger a\\nrepeat of the exception, unless the exception handler is able to modify values to prevent the\\nexception from reoccurring.\\nSome programming languages support dedicating a block of code to run regardless of whether\\nan exception occurs before the code is reached; this is called finalization.[87]\\n'),\n",

Standard libraries in some languages, such as C, use\\n[90]\\ntheir return values to indicate an exception. Some languages and their compilers have the\\noption of turning on and off error handling capability, either temporarily or permanently.[91]\\nDesign and implementation\\nOne of the most important influences on programming language design has been computer\\narchitecture. Imperative languages, the most commonly used type, were designed to perform\\n[92]\\nwell on von Neumann architecture, the most common computer architecture. In von\\nNeumann architecture, the memory stores both data and instructions, while the CPU that\\nperforms instructions on data is separate, and data must be piped back and forth to the CPU.\\nThe central elements in these languages are variables, assignment, and iteration, which is more\\nefficient than recursion on these machines.[93]\\nMany programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and\\ncombined with other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. The birth of\\nprogramming languages in the 1950s was stimulated by the desire to make a universal\\nprogramming language suitable for all machines and uses, avoiding the need to write code for\\n[94]\\ndifferent computers. By the early 1960s, the idea of a universal language was rejected due to\\n[95]\\nthe differing requirements of the variety of purposes for which code was written.\\nTradeoffs\\nDesirable qualities of programming languages include readability, writability, and reliability.[96]\\nThese features can reduce the cost of training programmers in a language, the amount of time\\nneeded to write and maintain programs in the language, the cost of compiling the code, and\\n[97]\\nincrease runtime performance.\\nAlthough early programming languages often prioritized efficiency over readability, the latter\\nhas grown in importance since the 1970s. Having multiple operations to achieve the same\\nresult can be detrimental to readability, as is overloading operators, so that the same\\n[98]\\noperator can have multiple meanings. Another feature important to readability is\\northogonality, limiting the number of constructs that a programmer has to learn.[99] A syntax\\nstructure that is easily understood and special words that are immediately obvious also\\n[100]\\nsupports readability.\\nWritability is the ease of use for writing code to solve the desired problem. Along with the\\n[101]\\nsame features essential for readability, abstraction—interfaces that enable hiding details\\nfrom the client—and expressivity—enabling more concise programs—additionally help the\\nprogrammer write code.[102] The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to\\nthe underlying hardware of the computer, but over time support for abstraction has\\nincreased, allowing programmers to express ideas that are more remote from simple\\ntranslation into underlying hardware instructions.

The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in\\nthe behavior of the reference implementation.\\nImplementation\\nAn implementation of a programming language is the conversion of a program into machine\\ncode that can be executed by the hardware. The machine code then can be executed with the\\nhelp of the operating system.[114] The most common form of interpretation in production code\\nis by a compiler, which translates the source code via an intermediate-level language into\\nmachine code, known as an executable.

Hybrid interpretation methods provide some of the benefits of compilation and\\nsome of the benefits of interpretation via partial compilation. One form this takes is just-in-time\\ncompilation, in which the software is compiled ahead of time into an intermediate language,\\nand then into machine code immediately before execution.[118]\\nProprietary languages\\nAlthough most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open\\nspecifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary\\nprogramming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor, which\\nmay claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property. Proprietary\\nprogramming languages are commonly domain-specific languages or internal scripting\\nlanguages for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a\\nvendor, while others are available to external users.\\nSome programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example,\\nOracle Corporation asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the Java programming\\n[119]\\nlanguage, and Microsoft\\'s C# programming language, which has open implementations of\\nmost parts of the system, also has Common Language Runtime (CLR) as a closed environment.\\n[120]\\nMany proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature; examples\\ninclude MATLAB, VBScript, and Wolfram Language. Some languages may make the transition\\nfrom closed to open; for example, Erlang was originally Ericsson\\'s internal programming\\n[121]\\nlanguage.\\nOpen source programming languages are particularly helpful for open science applications,\\n[122]\\nenhancing the capacity for replication and code sharing.\\nUse\\nThousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computing\\nfield.[123] Individual software projects commonly use five programming languages or more.[124]\\nProgramming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require\\na greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate\\nwith other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and\\nstill expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers \"do exactly\\nwhat they are told to do\", and cannot \"understand\" what code the programmer intended to\\nwrite. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program\\'s inputs must\\nfully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain\\nof control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated\\nto humans without the precision required for execution by using pseudocode, which interleaves\\nnatural language with code written in a programming language.\\n'),\n",

A\\nprogrammer uses the abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in\\na computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available\\n[125]\\n(called primitives). Programming is the process by which programmers combine these\\nprimitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing\\nenvironment.\\nPrograms for a computer might be executed in a batch process without any human interaction,\\nor a user might type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter. In this case the\\n\"commands\" are simply programs, whose execution is chained together. When a language can\\nrun its commands through an interpreter (such as a Unix shell or other command-line\\ninterface), without compiling, it is called a scripting language.[126]\\nMeasuring language usage\\nDetermining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the\\ndefinition of usage varies by context. One language may occupy the greater number of\\nprogrammer hours, a different one has more lines of code, and a third may consume the most\\nCPU time. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications. For example,\\n[127][128]\\nCOBOL is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large mainframes; Fortran\\nin scientific and engineering applications; Ada in aerospace, transportation, military, real-time,\\nand embedded applications; and C in embedded applications and operating systems. Other\\nlanguages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications.\\nVarious methods of measuring language popularity, each subject to a different bias over what is\\nmeasured, have been proposed:\\n[129]\\ncounting the number of job advertisements that mention the language\\nthe number of books sold that teach or describe the language[130]\\nestimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language – which may\\n[131]\\nunderestimate languages not often found in public searches\\ncounts of language references (i.e., to the name of the language) found using a web search\\nengine.\\nCombining and averaging information from various internet sites, stackify.com reported the ten\\nmost popular programming languages (in descending order by overall popularity): Java, C,\\n[132]\\nC++, Python, C#, JavaScript, VB .NET, R, PHP, and MATLAB.\\nAs of June 2024, the top five programming languages as measured by TIOBE index are Python,\\nC++, C, Java and C#. TIOBE provides a list of top 100 programming languages according to\\npopularity and update this list every month.[133]\\nAccording to IEEE Spectrum staff, today\\'s most popular programming languages may remain\\ndominant because of how AI works. As a result, new languages will have a harder time gaining\\n[134]\\npopularity since coders will not write many programs in them.\\n'),\n",

Although appreciated by many researchers for their simplicity and elegance,\\n[137]\\nproblems with efficiency have prevented them from being widely adopted.\\nLogic\\nA logic programming language is designed so that the software, rather than the programmer,\\ndecides what order in which the instructions are executed.[138]\\nObject-oriented\\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) is characterized by features such as data abstraction,\\ninheritance, and dynamic dispatch.

Computer architecture describes the\\ncomplexity theory\\nconstruction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence and machine\\nlearning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making,\\nenvironmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and\\nprocess image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.\\nThe fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.[2][8][3][9][10] The Turing Award is generally recognized as\\nthe highest distinction in computer science.[11][12]\\nHistory\\nThe earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer.\\nMachines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as\\nmultiplication and division. Algorithms for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development\\nof sophisticated computing equipment.[16]\\nWilhelm Schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in 1623.[17] In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz\\ndemonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the Stepped Reckoner.[18] Leibniz may be considered the first computer\\nscientist and information theorist, because of various reasons, including the fact that he documented the binary number system.\\nIn 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry[note 1] when he invented his simplified arithmometer,\\nthe first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. Charles Babbage\\nstarted the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the\\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\\nidea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine.[19] He started developing this machine in 1834, (1646–1716) developed\\nand \"in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer\".[20] \"A crucial step was logic in a binary number\\nthe adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom\"[20] making it infinitely programmable.[note 2] In 1843, system and has been\\nduring the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, called the \"founder of\\nan algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically computer science\".[13]\\ntailored for implementation on a computer.[21] Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator, which used punched\\ncards to process statistical information; eventually his company became part of IBM. Following Babbage, although unaware\\nof his earlier work, Percy Ludgate in 1909 published[22] the 2nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in\\nhistory. In 1914, the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo published his Essays on Automatics,[23] and designed,\\ninspired by Babbage, a theoretical electromechanical calculating machine which was to be controlled by a read-only\\nprogram. The paper also introduced the idea of floating-point arithmetic.[24][25] In 1920, to celebrate the 100th anniversary\\nof the invention of the arithmometer, Torres presented in Paris the Electromechanical Arithmometer, a prototype that\\ndemonstrated the feasibility of an electromechanical analytical engine,[26] on which commands could be typed and the\\nresults printed automatically.[27] In 1937, one hundred years after Babbage\\'s impossible dream, Howard Aiken convinced\\nIBM, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business[28] to develop his giant\\nprogrammable calculator, the ASCC/Harvard Mark I, based on Babbage\\'s Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a\\ncentral computing unit. When the machine was finished, some hailed it as \"Babbage\\'s dream come true\".[29] Charles Babbage is sometimes\\nreferred to as the \"father of\\ncomputing\".[14]\\nDuring the 1940s, with the development of new and more powerful computing machines such as the Atanasoff–Berry\\ncomputer and ENIAC, the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors.[30] As it\\nbecame clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study computation in\\ngeneral. In 1945, IBM founded the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University in New York City. The renovated fraternity house on\\nManhattan\\'s West Side was IBM\\'s first laboratory devoted to pure science. The lab is the forerunner of IBM\\'s Research Division, which today operates\\nresearch facilities around the world.[31] Ultimately, the close relationship between IBM and Columbia University was instrumental in the emergence of a\\nnew scientific discipline, with Columbia offering one of the first academic-credit courses in computer science in 1946.[32] Computer science began to be\\nestablished as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s.[33][34] The world\\'s first computer science degree program, the Cambridge\\nDiploma in Computer Science, began at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in 1953. The first computer science department in the United\\nStates was formed at Purdue University in 1962.[35] Since practical computers became available, many applications of computing have become distinct\\nareas of study in their own rights.\\nEtymology and scope\\n'),\n",

Because of this, several alternative names have been proposed.[40] Certain departments\\nof major universities prefer the term computing science, to emphasize precisely that difference. Danish scientist Peter Naur\\nsuggested the term datalogy,[41] to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment,\\nwhile not necessarily involving computers. The first scientific institution to use the term was the Department of Datalogy at\\nthe University of Copenhagen, founded in 1969, with Peter Naur being the first professor in datalogy. The term is used\\nmainly in the Scandinavian countries. An alternative term, also proposed by Naur, is data science; this is now used for a\\nmulti-disciplinary field of data analysis, including statistics and databases.\\nAda Lovelace published the\\nIn the early days of computing, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested (albeit first algorithm intended for\\nfacetiously) in the Communications of the ACM—turingineer, turologist, flow-charts-man, applied meta-mathematician, processing on a computer.[15]\\nand applied epistemologist.[42] Three months later in the same journal, comptologist was suggested, followed next year by\\nhypologist.[43] The term computics has also been suggested.[44] In Europe, terms derived from contracted translations of\\nthe expression \"automatic information\" (e.g. \"informazione automatica\" in Italian) or \"information and mathematics\" are often used, e.g. informatique\\n(French), Informatik (German), informatica (Italian, Dutch), informática (Spanish, Portuguese), informatika (Slavic languages and Hungarian) or\\npliroforiki (πληροφορική, which means informatics) in Greek. Similar words have also been adopted in the UK (as in the School of Informatics, University\\nof Edinburgh).[45] \"In the U.S., however, informatics is linked with applied computing, or computing in the context of another domain.\"[46]\\nA folkloric quotation, often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—Edsger Dijkstra, states that \"computer science is no more about\\ncomputers than astronomy is about telescopes.\"[note 3] The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the\\nprovince of disciplines other than computer science. For example, the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of computer engineering,\\nwhile the study of commercial computer systems and their deployment is often called information technology or information systems. However, there has\\nbeen exchange of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines. Computer science research also often intersects other disciplines, such as\\ncognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, physics, biology, Earth science, statistics, philosophy, and logic.\\nComputer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying\\nthat computing is a mathematical science.[33] Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as Kurt Gödel, Alan\\nTuring, John von Neumann, Rózsa Péter, Stephen Kleene, and Alonzo Church and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two\\nfields in areas such as mathematical logic, category theory, domain theory, and algebra.[36]\\nThe relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by disputes over what the term\\n\"software engineering\" means, and how computer science is defined.[47] David Parnas, taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and\\nscience disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus\\nof software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines.[48]\\nThe academic, political, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department is formed with a mathematical emphasis or with\\nan engineering emphasis. Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with\\ncomputational science. Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.\\nPhilosophy\\nEpistemology of computer science\\nDespite the word science in its name, there is debate over whether or not computer science is a discipline of science,[49] mathematics,[50] or engineering.[51]\\nAllen Newell and Herbert A. Simon argued in 1975,\\nComputer science is an empirical discipline. We would have called it an experimental science, but like astronomy, economics, and geology, some\\nof its unique forms of observation and experience do not fit a narrow stereotype of the experimental method. Nonetheless, they are experiments.\\nEach new machine that is built is an experiment. Actually constructing the machine poses a question to nature; and we listen for the answer by\\nobserving the machine in operation and analyzing it by all analytical and measurement means available.[51]\\nIt has since been argued that computer science can be classified as an empirical science since it makes use of empirical testing to evaluate the correctness of\\nprograms, but a problem remains in defining the laws and theorems of computer science (if any exist) and defining the nature of experiments in computer\\nscience.[51] Proponents of classifying computer science as an engineering discipline argue that the reliability of computational systems is investigated in the\\nsame way as bridges in civil engineering and airplanes in aerospace engineering.[51] They also argue that while empirical sciences observe what presently\\nexists, computer science observes what is possible to exist and while scientists discover laws from observation, no proper laws have been found in computer\\nscience and it is instead concerned with creating phenomena.[51]\\nProponents of classifying computer science as a mathematical discipline argue that computer programs are physical realizations of mathematical entities\\nand programs that can be deductively reasoned through mathematical formal methods.[51] Computer scientists Edsger W.

In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence,\\ncomputer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer\\ngraphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science.[56]\\nTheoretical computer science\\nTheoretical computer science is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation. It aims to\\nunderstand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies.\\nTheory of computation\\nAccording to Peter Denning, the fundamental question underlying computer science is, \"What can be automated?\"[3] Theory of computation is focused on\\nanswering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations. In an effort to\\nanswer the first question, computability theory examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical models of computation. The\\nsecond question is addressed by computational complexity theory, which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a\\nmultitude of computational problems.\\nThe famous P = NP? problem, one of the Millennium Prize Problems,[59] is an open problem in the theory of computation.\\nAutomata theory Formal languages Computability theory Computational complexity theory\\nModels of computation Quantum computing theory Logic circuit theory Cellular automata\\nInformation and coding theory\\nInformation theory, closely related to probability and statistics, is related to the quantification of information. This was developed by Claude Shannon to\\nfind fundamental limits on signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data.[60] Coding theory is the\\nstudy of the properties of codes (systems for converting information from one form to another) and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used\\nfor data compression, cryptography, error detection and correction, and more recently also for network coding. Codes are studied for the purpose of\\ndesigning efficient and reliable data transmission methods.

It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting mathematics,\\nsoftware engineering, and linguistics. It is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.\\nFormal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware\\nsystems.[62] The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines,\\nperforming appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. They form an important theoretical\\nunderpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they\\nhelp avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods\\nmeans that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and life-critical systems, where safety or security is of utmost importance.\\nFormal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals, in particular logic calculi,\\nformal languages, automata theory, and program semantics, but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware\\nspecification and verification.\\nFormal semantics Type theory Compiler design Programming languages Formal verification Automated theorem proving\\nApplied computer science\\nComputer graphics and visualization\\nComputer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves the synthesis and manipulation of image data.

A major usage of scientific computing is simulation of various processes,\\nincluding computational fluid dynamics, physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, societies and social situations (notably war games) along\\nwith their habitats, and interactions among biological cells. Modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft.

AI is associated in the popular mind with robotic development, but the\\nmain field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of software development, which require computational understanding.\\nThe starting point in the late 1940s was Alan Turing\\'s question \"Can computers think?\", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the\\nTuring test is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence.

Digital databases are managed using database management systems to\\nstore, create, maintain, and search data, through database models and query languages.

Common programming paradigms include:\\nFunctional programming, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical\\nfunctions and avoids state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or\\ndeclarations instead of statements.[74]\\nImperative programming, a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program\\'s state.[75] In much the same way that the imperative\\nmood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming\\nfocuses on describing how a program operates.\\nObject-oriented programming, a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known\\nas attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object\\'s procedures can access and often\\nmodify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with\\none another.[76]\\nService-oriented programming, a programming paradigm that uses \"services\" as the unit of computer work, to design and implement integrated\\nbusiness applications and mission critical software programs.\\nMany languages offer support for multiple paradigms, making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities.[77]\\nResearch\\nConferences are important events for computer science research. During these conferences, researchers from the public and private sectors present their\\nrecent work and meet. Unlike in most other academic fields, in computer science, the prestige of conference papers is greater than that of journal\\npublications.[78][79] One proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results,\\na task better handled by conferences than by journals.[80]\\nSee also\\nComputer science education\\nGlossary of computer science\\nList of computer scientists\\nList of computer science awards\\nElectronics and Computer Engineering\\nList of pioneers in computer science\\nOutline of computer science\\nNotes\\n1.

Historically, on many systems a thread\\ncould run until it relinquished control (cooperative multitasking).

Parallelism with\\nmultiple threads running on different CPUs can speed up a program, depending on how much\\n[91]\\nof it can be executed concurrently.\\nFile system\\nPermanent storage devices used in twenty-first century\\ncomputers, unlike volatile dynamic random-access\\nmemory (DRAM), are still accessible after a crash or\\npower failure. Permanent (non-volatile) storage is much\\ncheaper per byte, but takes several orders of magnitude\\nlonger to access, read, and write.[92][93] The two main\\ntechnologies are a hard drive consisting of magnetic\\ndisks, and flash memory (a solid-state drive that stores\\ndata in electrical circuits). The latter is more expensive\\n[94][95]\\nbut faster and more durable. File systems allow users and programs to\\norganize and sort files on a computer,\\nFile systems are an abstraction used by the operating often through the use of directories (or\\nsystem to simplify access to permanent storage. They folders).\\nprovide human-readable filenames and other metadata,\\nincrease performance via amortization of accesses,\\nprevent multiple threads from accessing the same section of memory, and include checksums to\\n[96]\\nidentify corruption. File systems are composed of files (named collections of data, of an\\narbitrary size) and directories (also called folders) that list human-readable filenames and other\\ndirectories.[97] An absolute file path begins at the root directory and lists subdirectories divided\\n[98][99]\\nby punctuation, while a relative path defines the location of a file from a directory.\\nSystem calls (which are sometimes wrapped by libraries) enable applications to create, delete,\\nopen, and close files, as well as link, read, and write to them. All these operations are carried out\\n[100]\\nby the operating system on behalf of the application. The operating system's efforts to\\nreduce latency include storing recently requested blocks of memory in a cache and prefetching\\ndata that the application has not asked for, but might need next.[101] Device drivers are software\\nspecific to each input/output (I/O) device that enables the operating system to work without\\n[102][103]\\nmodification over different hardware.\\nAnother component of file systems is a dictionary that maps a file's name and metadata to the\\n[104]\\ndata block where its contents are stored. Most file systems use directories to convert file\\nnames to file numbers. To find the block number, the operating system uses an index (often\\nimplemented as a tree).[105] Separately, there is a free space map to track free blocks, commonly\\n[105]\\nimplemented as a bitmap. Although any free block can be used to store a new file, many\\noperating systems try to group together files in the same directory to maximize performance, or\\n[106]\\nperiodically reorganize files to reduce fragmentation.\\n\"),\n",

As with other\\ncomputer systems, isolating security domains—in the case of operating systems, the kernel,\\n[113]\\nprocesses, and virtual machines—is key to achieving security. Other ways to increase\\nsecurity include simplicity to minimize the attack surface, locking access to resources by default,\\nchecking all requests for authorization, principle of least authority (granting the minimum\\nprivilege essential for performing a task), privilege separation, and reducing shared data.[114]\\nSome operating system designs are more secure than others. Those with no isolation between\\nthe kernel and applications are least secure, while those with a monolithic kernel like most\\ngeneral-purpose operating systems are still vulnerable if any part of the kernel is compromised.\\nA more secure design features microkernels that separate the kernel's privileges into many\\n[115]\\nseparate security domains and reduce the consequences of a single kernel breach.\\nUnikernels are another approach that improves security by minimizing the kernel and\\n[115]\\nseparating out other operating systems functionality by application.\\nMost operating systems are written in C or C++, which create potential vulnerabilities for\\nexploitation. Despite attempts to protect against them, vulnerabilities are caused by buffer\\noverflow attacks, which are enabled by the lack of bounds checking.[116] Hardware\\nvulnerabilities, some of them caused by CPU optimizations, can also be used to compromise the\\n[117]\\noperating system.

The ADT defines the logical\\nform of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.[5]\\nVarious types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are\\nhighly defined to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indice\\n[6]\\nfor data retrieval, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up\\n[7]\\nidentifiers.\\nData structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as\\nlarge databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to\\ndesigning efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages\\nemphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software\\ndesign. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of data stored in both\\nmain memory and secondary memory.[8]\\nImplementation\\nData structures can be implemented using a variety of programming languages and techniques,\\n[9]\\nbut they all share the common goal of efficiently organizing and storing data. Data structures\\nare generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its\\nmemory, specified by a pointer—a bit string, representing a memory address, that can be itself\\nstored in memory and manipulated by the program. Thus, the array and record data structures\\nare based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations, while the linked\\ndata structures are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself.

For instance, the contiguous memory allocation in arrays facilitates rapid access\\nand modification operations, leading to optimized performance in sequential data processing\\n[10]\\nscenarios.\\nThe implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set of procedures that create\\nand manipulate instances of that structure. The efficiency of a data structure cannot be analyzed\\nseparately from those operations. This observation motivates the theoretical concept of an\\nabstract data type, a data structure that is defined indirectly by the operations that may be\\nperformed on it, and the mathematical properties of those operations (including their space and\\ntime cost).[11]\\nExamples\\nThere are numerous types of data structures, generally\\nbuilt upon simpler primitive data types. Well known\\n[12]\\nexamples are:\\nAn array is a number of elements in a specific order,\\ntypically all of the same type (depending on the\\nlanguage, individual elements may either all be\\nforced to be the same type, or may be of almost any\\ntype). Elements are accessed using an integer index\\nto specify which element is required. Typical\\nimplementations allocate contiguous memory words\\nfor the elements of arrays (but this is not always a\\nnecessity). Arrays may be fixed-length or resizable.\\nA linked list (also just called list) is a linear collection\\nof data elements of any type, called nodes, where\\neach node has itself a value, and points to the next\\nnode in the linked list. The principal advantage of a\\nlinked list over an array is that values can always be\\nefficiently inserted and removed without relocating\\nthe rest of the list. Certain other operations, such as\\nrandom access to a certain element, are however The standard type hierarchy of the\\nslower on lists than on arrays. programming language Python 3.\\nA record (also called tuple or struct) is an aggregate\\ndata structure. A record is a value that contains\\nother values, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The\\nelements of records are usually called fields or members. In the context of object-oriented\\nprogramming, records are known as plain old data structures to distinguish them from\\nobjects.[13]\\nHash tables, also known as hash maps, are data structures that provide fast retrieval of\\nvalues based on keys. They use a hashing function to map keys to indexes in an array,\\nallowing for constant-time access in the average case. Hash tables are commonly used in\\ndictionaries, caches, and database indexing. However, hash collisions can occur, which can\\nimpact their performance. Techniques like chaining and open addressing are employed to\\nhandle collisions.\\nGraphs are collections of nodes connected by edges, representing relationships between\\nentities. Graphs can be used to model social networks, computer networks, and\\n'),\n",

They consist of vertices (nodes) and edges\\n(connections between nodes). Graphs can be directed or undirected, and they can have\\ncycles or be acyclic. Graph traversal algorithms include breadth-first search and depth-first\\nsearch.\\nStacks and queues are abstract data types that can be implemented using arrays or linked\\nlists. A stack has two primary operations: push (adds an element to the top of the stack) and\\npop (removes the topmost element from the stack), that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO)\\nprinciple. Queues have two main operations: enqueue (adds an element to the rear of the\\nqueue) and dequeue (removes an element from the front of the queue) that follow the First\\nIn, First Out (FIFO) principle.\\nTrees represent a hierarchical organization of elements. A tree consists of nodes connected\\nby edges, with one node being the root and all other nodes forming subtrees. Trees are\\nwidely used in various algorithms and data storage scenarios. Binary trees (particularly\\nheaps), AVL trees, and B-trees are some popular types of trees. They enable efficient and\\noptimal searching, sorting, and hierarchical representation of data.\\nA trie, or prefix tree, is a special type of tree used to efficiently retrieve strings. In a trie, each\\nnode represents a character of a string, and the edges between nodes represent the\\ncharacters that connect them. This structure is especially useful for tasks like autocomplete,\\nspell-checking, and creating dictionaries. Tries allow for quick searches and operations\\nbased on string prefixes.\\nLanguage support\\nMost assembly languages and some low-level languages, such as BCPL (Basic Combined\\nProgramming Language), lack built-in support for data structures. On the other hand, many\\nhigh-level programming languages and some higher-level assembly languages, such as MASM,\\nhave special syntax or other built-in support for certain data structures, such as records and\\narrays. For example, the C (a direct descendant of BCPL) and Pascal languages support structs\\nand records, respectively, in addition to vectors (one-dimensional arrays) and multi-\\ndimensional arrays.[14][15]\\nMost programming languages feature some sort of library mechanism that allows data structure\\nimplementations to be reused by different programs. Modern languages usually come with\\nstandard libraries that implement the most common data structures. Examples are the C++\\nStandard Template Library, the Java Collections Framework, and the Microsoft .NET\\nFramework.\\nModern languages also generally support modular programming, the separation between the\\ninterface of a library module and its implementation. Some provide opaque data types that\\nallow clients to hide implementation details. Object-oriented programming languages, such as\\nC++, Java, and Smalltalk, typically use classes for this purpose.\\nMany known data structures have concurrent versions which allow multiple computing threads\\n[16]\\nto access a single concrete instance of a data structure simultaneously.\\nSee also\\nAbstract data type\\nConcurrent data structure\\n'),\n",

In the United States, a claim consisting\\nsolely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute\\n\"processes\" (USPTO 2006), so algorithms are not patentable (as in Gottschalk v. Benson).\\nHowever practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in\\nDiamond v. Diehr, the application of a simple feedback algorithm to aid in the curing of\\n[51]\\nsynthetic rubber was deemed patentable. The patenting of software is controversial, and\\nthere are criticized patents involving algorithms, especially data compression algorithms, such\\nas Unisys\\'s LZW patent.

Iterative algorithms use repetitions such as\\nloops or data structures like stacks to solve problems. Problems may be suited for one\\nimplementation or the other. The Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle commonly solved using\\nrecursive implementation. Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or\\nless complex) iterative version, and vice versa.\\nSerial, parallel or distributed\\nAlgorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one\\ninstruction of an algorithm at a time on serial computers. Serial algorithms are designed\\nfor these environments, unlike parallel or distributed algorithms. Parallel algorithms take\\nadvantage of computer architectures where multiple processors can work on a problem at\\nthe same time. Distributed algorithms use multiple machines connected via a computer\\nnetwork. Parallel and distributed algorithms divide the problem into subproblems and\\ncollect the results back together. Resource consumption in these algorithms is not only\\nprocessor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the\\nprocessors. Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their\\ncommunication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable,\\nbut some problems have no parallel algorithms and are called inherently serial problems.\\nDeterministic or non-deterministic\\nDeterministic algorithms solve the problem with exact decisions at every step; whereas\\nnon-deterministic algorithms solve problems via guessing. Guesses are typically made\\nmore accurate through the use of heuristics.\\nExact or approximate\\nWhile many algorithms reach an exact solution, approximation algorithms seek an\\napproximation that is close to the true solution. Such algorithms have practical value for\\nmany hard problems. For example, the Knapsack problem, where there is a set of items,\\nand the goal is to pack the knapsack to get the maximum total value. Each item has some\\nweight and some value. The total weight that can be carried is no more than some fixed\\n[52]\\nnumber X. So, the solution must consider the weights of items as well as their value.\\nQuantum algorithm\\nQuantum algorithms run on a realistic model of quantum computation. The term is usually\\nused for those algorithms that seem inherently quantum or use some essential feature of\\nQuantum computing such as quantum superposition or quantum entanglement.\\nBy design paradigm\\nAnother way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. Some\\ncommon paradigms are:\\nBrute-force or exhaustive search\\nBrute force is a problem-solving method of systematically trying every possible option until\\nthe optimal solution is found. This approach can be very time-consuming, testing every\\npossible combination of variables. It is often used when other methods are unavailable or\\ntoo complex. Brute force can solve a variety of problems, including finding the shortest\\npath between two points and cracking passwords.\\nDivide and conquer\\nA divide-and-conquer algorithm repeatedly reduces a problem to one or more smaller\\ninstances of itself (usually recursively) until the instances are small enough to solve easily.\\nMerge sorting is an example of divide and conquer, where an unordered list is repeatedly\\nsplit into smaller lists, which are sorted in the same way and then merged.[53] In a simpler\\n'),\n",

A graph\\nexploration algorithm specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such\\nproblems. This category also includes search algorithms, branch and bound enumeration,\\nand backtracking.\\nRandomized algorithm\\nSuch algorithms make some choices randomly (or pseudo-randomly). They find\\napproximate solutions when finding exact solutions may be impractical (see heuristic\\nmethod below). For some problems, the fastest approximations must involve some\\nrandomness.[55] Whether randomized algorithms with polynomial time complexity can be\\nthe fastest algorithm for some problems is an open question known as the P versus NP\\nproblem. There are two large classes of such algorithms:\\n1. Monte Carlo algorithms return a correct answer with high probability. E.g. RP is the subclass\\nof these that run in polynomial time.\\n2. Las Vegas algorithms always return the correct answer, but their running time is only\\nprobabilistically bound, e.g. ZPP.\\nReduction of complexity\\nThis technique transforms difficult problems into better-known problems solvable with\\n(hopefully) asymptotically optimal algorithms. The goal is to find a reducing algorithm\\nwhose complexity is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithms. For example, one\\nselection algorithm finds the median of an unsorted list by first sorting the list (the\\nexpensive portion), and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap\\nportion). This technique is also known as transform and conquer.\\nBack tracking\\nIn this approach, multiple solutions are built incrementally and abandoned when it is\\ndetermined that they cannot lead to a valid full solution.\\nOptimization problems\\nFor optimization problems there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for\\nsuch problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as\\ninto one of the following:\\nLinear programming\\nWhen searching for optimal solutions to a linear function bound by linear equality and\\ninequality constraints, the constraints can be used directly to produce optimal solutions.\\nThere are algorithms that can solve any problem in this category, such as the popular\\n[56]\\nsimplex algorithm. Problems that can be solved with linear programming include the\\nmaximum flow problem for directed graphs. If a problem also requires that any of the\\nunknowns be integers, then it is classified in integer programming. A linear programming\\nalgorithm can solve such a problem if it can be proved that all restrictions for integer\\nvalues are superficial, i.e., the solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway. In the general\\ncase, a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used,\\ndepending on the difficulty of the problem.\\nDynamic programming\\nWhen a problem shows optimal substructures—meaning the optimal solution can be\\nconstructed from optimal solutions to subproblems—and overlapping subproblems,\\n'),\n",

For\\nexample, Floyd–Warshall algorithm, the shortest path between a start and goal vertex in a\\nweighted graph can be found using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices.\\nDynamic programming and memoization go together. Unlike divide and conquer, dynamic\\nprogramming subproblems often overlap. The difference between dynamic programming\\nand simple recursion is the caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems\\nare independent and do not repeat, memoization does not help; hence dynamic\\nprogramming is not applicable to all complex problems. Using memoization dynamic\\nprogramming reduces the complexity of many problems from exponential to polynomial.\\nThe greedy method\\nGreedy algorithms, similarly to a dynamic programming, work by examining substructures,\\nin this case not of the problem but of a given solution. Such algorithms start with some\\nsolution and improve it by making small modifications. For some problems, they always\\nfind the optimal solution but for others they may stop at local optima. The most popular\\nuse of greedy algorithms is finding minimal spanning trees of graphs without negative\\ncycles. Huffman Tree, Kruskal, Prim, Sollin are greedy algorithms that can solve this\\noptimization problem.\\nThe heuristic method\\nIn optimization problems, heuristic algorithms find solutions close to the optimal solution\\nwhen finding the optimal solution is impractical. These algorithms get closer and closer to\\nthe optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they\\nwill find the optimal solution. They can ideally find a solution very close to the optimal\\nsolution in a relatively short time. These algorithms include local search, tabu search,\\nsimulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. Some, like simulated annealing, are non-\\ndeterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound\\non the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as\\nan approximation algorithm.\\nExamples\\nOne of the simplest algorithms finds the largest number in a list of numbers of random order.\\nFinding the solution requires looking at every number in the list. From this follows a simple\\nalgorithm, which can be described in plain English as:\\nHigh-level description:\\n1. If a set of numbers is empty, then there is no highest number.\\n2. Assume the first number in the set is the largest.\\n3. For each remaining number in the set: if this number is greater than the current largest, it\\nbecomes the new largest.\\n4. When there are no unchecked numbers left in the set, consider the current largest number\\nto be the largest in the set.\\n(Quasi-)formal description: Written in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a\\ncomputer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in pseudocode or\\npidgin code:\\nAlgorithm LargestNumber\\nInput: A list of numbers L.\\n'),\n",

These performance increases were enabled by the technology progress in\\nthe areas of processors, computer memory, computer storage, and computer networks. The\\nconcept of a database was made possible by the emergence of direct access storage media such\\nas magnetic disks, which became widely available in the mid-1960s; earlier systems relied on\\nsequential storage of data on magnetic tape. The subsequent development of database\\ntechnology can be divided into three eras based on data model or structure: navigational,[8]\\nSQL/relational, and post-relational.\\nThe two main early navigational data models were the hierarchical model and the CODASYL\\nmodel (network model). These were characterized by the use of pointers (often physical disk\\naddresses) to follow relationships from one record to another.\\nThe relational model, first proposed in 1970 by Edgar F. Codd, departed from this tradition by\\ninsisting that applications should search for data by content, rather than by following links. The\\nrelational model employs sets of ledger-style tables, each used for a different type of entity. Only\\nin the mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough to allow the wide\\ndeployment of relational systems (DBMSs plus applications). By the early 1990s, however,\\nrelational systems dominated in all large-scale data processing applications, and as of 2018 they\\nremain dominant: IBM Db2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server are the most searched\\n[9]\\nDBMS. The dominant database language, standardized SQL for the relational model, has\\ninfluenced database languages for other data models.\\nObject databases were developed in the 1980s to overcome the inconvenience of object–\\nrelational impedance mismatch, which led to the coining of the term \"post-relational\" and also\\nthe development of hybrid object–relational databases.\\nThe next generation of post-relational databases in the late 2000s became known as NoSQL\\ndatabases, introducing fast key–value stores and document-oriented databases. A competing\\n\"next generation\" known as NewSQL databases attempted new implementations that retained\\nthe relational/SQL model while aiming to match the high performance of NoSQL compared to\\ncommercially available relational DBMSs.\\n1960s, navigational DBMS\\nThe introduction of the term database coincided with the availability of direct-access storage\\n(disks and drums) from the mid-1960s onwards. The term represented a contrast with the tape-\\nbased systems of the past, allowing shared interactive use rather than daily batch processing.\\nThe Oxford English Dictionary cites a 1962 report by the System Development Corporation of\\n[10]\\nCalifornia as the first to use the term \"data-base\" in a specific technical sense.\\n'),\n",

Codd worked at IBM in San Jose, California, in an office primarily involved in the\\n[12]\\ndevelopment of hard disk systems. He was unhappy with the navigational model of the\\nCODASYL approach, notably the lack of a \"search\" facility. In 1970, he wrote a number of\\npapers that outlined a new approach to database construction that eventually culminated in the\\ngroundbreaking A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.[13]\\nThe paper described a new system for storing and working with large databases. Instead of\\nrecords being stored in some sort of linked list of free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd\\'s idea\\nwas to organize the data as a number of \"tables\", each table being used for a different type of\\nentity. Each table would contain a fixed number of columns containing the attributes of the\\nentity. One or more columns of each table were designated as a primary key by which the rows\\nof the table could be uniquely identified; cross-references between tables always used these\\nprimary keys, rather than disk addresses, and queries would join tables based on these key\\nrelationships, using a set of operations based on the mathematical system of relational calculus\\n(from which the model takes its name). Splitting the data into a set of normalized tables (or\\nrelations) aimed to ensure that each \"fact\" was only stored once, thus simplifying update\\noperations. Virtual tables called views could present the data in different ways for different\\nusers, but views could not be directly updated.\\nCodd used mathematical terms to define the model: relations, tuples, and domains rather than\\ntables, rows, and columns. The terminology that is now familiar came from early\\nimplementations. Codd would later criticize the tendency for practical implementations to\\ndepart from the mathematical foundations on which the model was based.\\nThe use of primary keys (user-oriented identifiers) to\\nrepresent cross-table relationships, rather than disk\\naddresses, had two primary motivations. From an\\nengineering perspective, it enabled tables to be\\nrelocated and resized without expensive database\\nreorganization. But Codd was more interested in the\\ndifference in semantics: the use of explicit identifiers\\nmade it easier to define update operations with clean\\nmathematical definitions, and it also enabled query\\noperations to be defined in terms of the established\\ndiscipline of first-order predicate calculus; because\\nthese operations have clean mathematical properties, it In the relational model, records are\\n\"linked\" using virtual keys not stored in\\nbecomes possible to rewrite queries in provably correct\\nthe database but defined as needed\\nways, which is the basis of query optimization. There is\\nbetween the data contained in the\\nno loss of expressiveness compared with the hierarchic\\nrecords.\\nor network models, though the connections between\\ntables are no longer so explicit.\\nIn the hierarchic and network models, records were allowed to have a complex internal\\nstructure. For example, the salary history of an employee might be represented as a \"repeating\\ngroup\" within the employee record. In the relational model, the process of normalization led to\\nsuch internal structures being replaced by data held in multiple tables, connected only by logical\\nkeys.\\n'),\n",

Records would be created in these optional tables only if the address or phone\\nnumbers were actually provided.\\nAs well as identifying rows/records using logical identifiers rather than disk addresses, Codd\\nchanged the way in which applications assembled data from multiple records. Rather than\\nrequiring applications to gather data one record at a time by navigating the links, they would\\nuse a declarative query language that expressed what data was required, rather than the access\\npath by which it should be found. Finding an efficient access path to the data became the\\nresponsibility of the database management system, rather than the application programmer.\\nThis process, called query optimization, depended on the fact that queries were expressed in\\nterms of mathematical logic.\\nCodd\\'s paper inspired teams at various universities to research the subject, including one at\\n[12]\\nUniversity of California, Berkeley led by Eugene Wong and Michael Stonebraker, who started\\nINGRES using funding that had already been allocated for a geographical database project and\\nstudent programmers to produce code.

This allows for relations between data to be related to\\n[22]\\nobjects and their attributes and not to individual fields. The term \"object–relational\\nimpedance mismatch\" described the inconvenience of translating between programmed objects\\nand database tables. Object databases and object–relational databases attempt to solve this\\nproblem by providing an object-oriented language (sometimes as extensions to SQL) that\\nprogrammers can use as alternative to purely relational SQL.

XML databases are mostly used in applications where the data is\\nconveniently viewed as a collection of documents, with a structure that can vary from the very\\nflexible to the highly rigid: examples include scientific articles, patents, tax filings, and\\npersonnel records.\\nNoSQL databases are often very fast,[23][24] do not require fixed table schemas, avoid join\\noperations by storing denormalized data, and are designed to scale horizontally.\\nIn recent years, there has been a strong demand for massively distributed databases with high\\npartition tolerance, but according to the CAP theorem, it is impossible for a distributed system\\nto simultaneously provide consistency, availability, and partition tolerance guarantees. A\\ndistributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time, but not all three.\\nFor that reason, many NoSQL databases are using what is called eventual consistency to provide\\nboth availability and partition tolerance guarantees with a reduced level of data consistency.\\nNewSQL is a class of modern relational databases that aims to provide the same scalable\\nperformance of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (read-write) workloads while\\nstill using SQL and maintaining the ACID guarantees of a traditional database system.\\n'),\n",

In this case, typically middleware\\nis used for distribution, which typically includes an atomic commit protocol (ACP), e.g., the\\ntwo-phase commit protocol, to allow distributed (global) transactions across the participating\\ndatabases.\\nA graph database is a kind of NoSQL database that uses graph structures with nodes,\\nedges, and properties to represent and store information. General graph databases that can\\nstore any graph are distinct from specialized graph databases such as triplestores and\\nnetwork databases.\\nAn array DBMS is a kind of NoSQL DBMS that allows modeling, storage, and retrieval of\\n(usually large) multi-dimensional arrays such as satellite images and climate simulation\\noutput.\\nIn a hypertext or hypermedia database, any word or a piece of text representing an object,\\ne.g., another piece of text, an article, a picture, or a film, can be hyperlinked to that object.\\nHypertext databases are particularly useful for organizing large amounts of disparate\\ninformation. For example, they are useful for organizing online encyclopedias, where users\\ncan conveniently jump around the text. The World Wide Web is thus a large distributed\\nhypertext database.\\n[26][27]\\nA knowledge base (abbreviated KB, kb or Δ ) is a special kind of database for\\nknowledge management, providing the means for the computerized collection, organization,\\nand retrieval of knowledge. Also a collection of data representing problems with their\\nsolutions and related experiences.\\nA mobile database can be carried on or synchronized from a mobile computing device.\\nOperational databases store detailed data about the operations of an organization. They\\ntypically process relatively high volumes of updates using transactions. Examples include\\ncustomer databases that record contact, credit, and demographic information about a\\nbusiness's customers, personnel databases that hold information such as salary, benefits,\\nskills data about employees, enterprise resource planning systems that record details about\\nproduct components, parts inventory, and financial databases that keep track of the\\norganization's money, accounting and financial dealings.\\nA parallel database seeks to improve performance through parallelization for tasks such as\\nloading data, building indexes and evaluating queries.\\nThe major parallel DBMS architectures which are induced by the underlying\\nhardware architecture are:\\nShared memory architecture, where multiple processors share the main\\nmemory space, as well as other data storage.\\nShared disk architecture, where each processing unit (typically consisting of\\nmultiple processors) has its own main memory, but all units share the other\\nstorage.\\nShared-nothing architecture, where each processing unit has its own main\\nmemory and other storage.\\n\"),\n",

The client–server\\narchitecture was a development where the application resided on a client desktop and the\\ndatabase on a server allowing the processing to be distributed. This evolved into a multitier\\narchitecture incorporating application servers and web servers with the end user interface via a\\nweb browser with the database only directly connected to the adjacent tier.[32]\\nA general-purpose DBMS will provide public application programming interfaces (API) and\\noptionally a processor for database languages such as SQL to allow applications to be written to\\ninteract with and manipulate the database. A special purpose DBMS may use a private API and\\nbe specifically customized and linked to a single application. For example, an email system\\nperforms many of the functions of a general-purpose DBMS such as message insertion, message\\ndeletion, attachment handling, blocklist lookup, associating messages an email address and so\\nforth however these functions are limited to what is required to handle email.\\nApplication\\nExternal interaction with the database will be via an application program that interfaces with\\n[33]\\nthe DBMS. This can range from a database tool that allows users to execute SQL queries\\ntextually or graphically, to a website that happens to use a database to store and search\\ninformation.\\nApplication program interface\\nA programmer will code interactions to the database (sometimes referred to as a datasource) via\\nan application program interface (API) or via a database language. The particular API or\\nlanguage chosen will need to be supported by DBMS, possibly indirectly via a preprocessor or a\\nbridging API. Some API's aim to be database independent, ODBC being a commonly known\\nexample.

It was one of the first commercial languages for the relational model, although it\\ndeparts in some respects from the relational model as described by Codd (for example, the\\nrows and columns of a table can be ordered). SQL became a standard of the American\\nNational Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for\\nStandardization (ISO) in 1987. The standards have been regularly enhanced since and are\\nsupported (with varying degrees of conformance) by all mainstream commercial relational\\n[34][35]\\nDBMSs.\\nOQL is an object model language standard (from the Object Data Management Group). It\\nhas influenced the design of some of the newer query languages like JDOQL and EJB QL.\\nXQuery is a standard XML query language implemented by XML database systems such as\\nMarkLogic and eXist, by relational databases with XML capability such as Oracle and Db2,\\nand also by in-memory XML processors such as Saxon.\\nSQL/XML combines XQuery with SQL.[36]\\nA database language may also incorporate features like:\\nDBMS-specific configuration and storage engine management\\nComputations to modify query results, like counting, summing, averaging, sorting, grouping,\\nand cross-referencing\\nConstraint enforcement (e.g. in an automotive database, only allowing one engine type per\\ncar)\\nApplication programming interface version of the query language, for programmer\\nconvenience\\nStorage\\nDatabase storage is the container of the physical materialization of a database. It comprises the\\ninternal (physical) level in the database architecture. It also contains all the information needed\\n(e.g., metadata, \"data about the data\", and internal data structures) to reconstruct the\\nconceptual level and external level from the internal level when needed.

A common example is storing\\nmaterialized views, which consist of frequently needed external views or query results. Storing\\nsuch views saves the expensive computing them each time they are needed. The downsides of\\nmaterialized views are the overhead incurred when updating them to keep them synchronized\\nwith their original updated database data, and the cost of storage redundancy.\\nReplication\\nOccasionally a database employs storage redundancy by database objects replication (with one\\nor more copies) to increase data availability (both to improve performance of simultaneous\\nmultiple end-user accesses to the same database object, and to provide resiliency in a case of\\npartial failure of a distributed database). Updates of a replicated object need to be synchronized\\nacross the object copies. In many cases, the entire database is replicated.\\nVirtualization\\nWith data virtualization, the data used remains in its original locations and real-time access is\\nestablished to allow analytics across multiple sources.

The reasons are primarily economical (different DBMSs may have different total costs\\nof ownership or TCOs), functional, and operational (different DBMSs may have different\\ncapabilities). The migration involves the database's transformation from one DBMS type to\\nanother. The transformation should maintain (if possible) the database related application (i.e.,\\nall related application programs) intact. Thus, the database's conceptual and external\\narchitectural levels should be maintained in the transformation. It may be desired that also\\nsome aspects of the architecture internal level are maintained. A complex or large database\\nmigration may be a complicated and costly (one-time) project by itself, which should be\\nfactored into the decision to migrate.

It is concerned with cost, performance,\\nscalability and other operational matters. It deals with storage layout of the data, using\\nstorage structures such as indexes to enhance performance. Occasionally it stores data of\\nindividual views (materialized views), computed from generic data, if performance\\njustification exists for such redundancy. It balances all the external views' performance\\nrequirements, possibly conflicting, in an attempt to optimize overall performance across all\\nactivities.\\nWhile there is typically only one conceptual and internal view of the data, there can be any\\nnumber of different external views. This allows users to see database information in a more\\nbusiness-related way rather than from a technical, processing viewpoint. For example, a\\nfinancial department of a company needs the payment details of all employees as part of the\\ncompany's expenses, but does not need details about employees that are in the interest of the\\nhuman resources department. Thus different departments need different views of the\\ncompany's database.\\nThe three-level database architecture relates to the concept of data independence which was\\n[43]\\none of the major initial driving forces of the relational model. The idea is that changes made\\nat a certain level do not affect the view at a higher level. For example, changes in the internal\\nlevel do not affect application programs written using conceptual level interfaces, which reduces\\nthe impact of making physical changes to improve performance.\\nThe conceptual view provides a level of indirection between internal and external. On the one\\nhand it provides a common view of the database, independent of different external view\\nstructures, and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or\\nmanaged (internal level). In principle every level, and even every external view, can be\\npresented by a different data model. In practice usually a given DBMS uses the same data model\\nfor both the external and the conceptual levels (e.g., relational model). The internal level, which\\nis hidden inside the DBMS and depends on its implementation, requires a different level of\\ndetail and uses its own types of data structure types.\\nResearch\\nDatabase technology has been an active research topic since the 1960s, both in academia and in\\nthe research and development groups of companies (for example IBM Research). Research\\nactivity includes theory and development of prototypes. Notable research topics have included\\nmodels, the atomic transaction concept, related concurrency control techniques, query\\nlanguages and query optimization methods, RAID, and more.\\nThe database research area has several dedicated academic journals (for example, ACM\\nTransactions on Database Systems-TODS, Data and Knowledge Engineering-DKE) and\\nannual conferences (e.g., ACM SIGMOD, ACM PODS, VLDB, IEEE ICDE).\\nSee also\\nComparison of database tools\\nComparison of object database management systems\\n\"),\n",
